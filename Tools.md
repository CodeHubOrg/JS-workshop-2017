**To work through the examples in this repo, have the following installed on your computer:**        

- A good text editor (e.g. Sublime, Atom, WebStorm, Brackets, Visual Studio Code)     
- Terminal with Unix commandline tools   
- Node and npm - npm comes bundled with the Node installation https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
- Git    

Note for windows users:      

*Node*       
You can install Node with a Windows installer from the [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You will need to make sure that Node is added to the PATH variable as mentioned in this post:

*Git and Commandline Tools*               
This post talks you through installing Git and with it Unix commandline tools. If you are on Windows, Visual Studio Code (also mentioned in the post) would be a good editor to use

(If you do not want to install things on your computer, you could use a cloud IDE like https://ide.c9.io)
